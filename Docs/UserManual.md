## Introduction

This is Team 121's Group Project for Georgia Tech CS6300: Software Development Process. For this project, we created a Job Compare Android Application. This application is designed with the following features outlined in this User Manual: Add Current Job, Add New Job Offer, Compare Jobs and Modify Comparison Settings. The **Main Menu** (shown below) gives the user the options to  - **Add Current Job**, **Add New Job Offer**, **Compare Jobs** and **Modify Comparison Settings**.

In the interface that comes up, the user enters the details of the current job - **Job Title**, **Company Name**, **Location**, **Overall Living Cost**, **Commute Time**, **Yearly Salary**, **Yearly Bonus**, **Retirement Benefits** and **Leave Time**. The user can then save the entry or exit that particular interface and return to the main menu.
