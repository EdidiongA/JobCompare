# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 121

- Version 1 : Initial release
- Version 2 : Final Version. Updated project responsibilites

## 1 Introduction

In this project we will develop an application that will enable user  to compare Job offers over different aspects such as compensation, benefits and  location. 

## 2 Process Description

## 2.1 Inception

Identify  and formalize system and resource requirements based on the information provided in project  specification. A high level inception of the proposed design will  also be developed.

- *Entrance Criteria* : Problem Statement and Requirement documentation for  the *jobCompare* application
- *Exit Criteria*:  A high level System Design Document and  UML Class Diagram for the application

## 2.2 Elaboration

Understand and address low level functional and non-functional requirements. If needed, *Design Document* will be reviewed and updated to include micro-architecture details. At this stage, a test plan will be developed and reviewed among the team members.

- *Entrance Criteria* : Requirement Document and High Level Design Document and Class Diagram
- *Exit Criteria*:  Test-plan Document, Use-case Model, Supplemental requirements  and updated Design Architecture

## 2.3 Construction

Development of the application in *Android Studio* will take place in this activity. We may need to update the system architecture, use cases, test plan and project-plan (this document ) based on the understanding and constraints of the project. Test development and product development will take place parallelly to save time and improve efficiency.

- *Entrance Criteria* : All documents needed as *Exit Criteria* in *Elaboration*
- *Exit Criteria*:  A working application with a subset of planned test-cases. Refined Test-plan Document, Use-case Model, Supplemental requirements  and updated Design Architecture to reflect the implemented design.

## 2.4 Transition

Refinement of the design and implementation of complete test suite will take place. Efforts to fix bugs and update documentation to reflect the implemented design.

- *Entrance Criteria* : A working application and updated documentation to reflect the implementation
- *Exit Criteria*:  A bug free fully functional application and test-suite ready to release. Fully updated documentation for release.
